# React Water App

The React Water App is a frontend application built with React that integrates with the React Water Backend to manage and display water-related data. This project runs on Repl.it, providing a seamless interface for interacting with the backend API.

## Project Overview

The React Water App serves as the user interface for the water management system. It communicates with the backend server to fetch, display, and manipulate water data. Users can view current water usage, add new entries, update existing data, and remove records as needed.

## Features

- **React Frontend**: Built using React for a dynamic and responsive user interface.
- **API Integration**: Communicates with the React Water Backend using AJAX requests to fetch and update data.
- **Real-Time Updates**: Provides real-time data updates and displays, ensuring users always see the latest information.
- **Responsive Design**: The UI is designed to work across various devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
- **Repl.it Integration**: The project runs on Repl.it, allowing easy access and deployment of the app.

## Getting Started

This README covers the `react-water-app`, explaining its features, setup instructions, integration with the backend, project structure, and how to run it both locally and on Repl.it.

## Running React on Repl.it

[React](https://reactjs.org/) is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) is a blazing fast frontend build tool that includes features like Hot Module Reloading (HMR), optimized builds, and TypeScript support out of the box.

Using the two in conjunction is one of the fastest ways to build a web app.

### Getting Started
- Hit run
- Edit [App.jsx](#src/App.jsx) and watch it live update!

By default, Replit runs the `dev` script, but you can configure it by changing the `run` field in the `.replit` file.
